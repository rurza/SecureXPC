/// An XPC server to receive requests from and send responses to an ``XPCClient``.
///
/// ### Retrieving a Server
/// There are two different types of services you can retrieve a server for: XPC services and XPC Mach services. If you're uncertain which type of service you're
/// using, it's likely an XPC service.
///
/// Anonymous servers can also be created which do not correspond to an XPC service or XPC Mach service.
///
/// #### XPC services
/// These are helper tools which ship as part of your app and only your app can communicate with.
///
/// To retrieve a server for an XPC service:
/// ```swift
/// let server = try XPCServer.forThisXPCService()
/// ```
///
/// #### XPC Mach services
/// In most cases, to retrieve a server for an XPC Mach service:
/// ```swift
/// let server = try XPCServer.forMachService()
/// ```
///
/// This will automatically work for many common configurations including:
/// - Helper tools installed using
/// [`SMJobBless`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/servicemanagement/1431078-smjobbless)
/// - Login items enabled with
///  [`SMLoginItemSetEnabled`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/servicemanagement/1501557-smloginitemsetenabled)
/// - Daemons registered via
/// [`SMAppService.daemon(plistName:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/servicemanagement/smappservice/3945410-daemon)
/// - Agents registered via
/// [`SMAppService.agent(plistName:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/servicemanagement/smappservice/3945409-agent)
///
/// See ``XPCServer/forMachService(withCriteria:)`` for details and how to retrieve a server for any XPC Mach service or to customize the
/// requirements of connecting clients.
///
/// #### Anonymous servers
/// An anonymous server can be created by any macOS program:
/// ```swift
/// let server = XPCServer.makeAnonymous()
/// ```
/// Use cases for making one include:
///  - Allowing two processes which are not XPC services to communicate over XPC with each other. This is done by having one of those processes make an
///    anonymous server and send its ``XPCServer/endpoint`` to an XPC Mach service. The other process then needs to retrieve that endpoint from the XPC
///    Mach service and create a client using ``XPCClient/forEndpoint(_:withServerRequirement:)``.
///  - Testing code that would otherwise run as part of an XPC Mach service without needing to install a helper tool. However, note that this code won't run as root.
///
/// ### Registering & Handling Routes
/// Once a server instance has been retrieved, one or more routes should be registered with it. This is done by calling one of the `registerRoute` functions and
/// providing a route and a compatible closure or function. For example:
/// ```swift
///     ...
///     let updateRoute = XPCRoute.named("config", "update")
///                               .withMessageType(Config.self)
///                               .withReplyType(Config.self)
///     server.registerRoute(updateRoute, handler: updateConfig)
/// }
///
/// private func updateConfig(_ config: Config) throws -> Config {
///     <# implementation here #>
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Routes with sequential reply types can respond to the client arbitrarily many times and therefore must explicitly provide responses to a
/// ``SequentialResultProvider``:
/// ```swift
///     ...
///     let changesRoute = XPCRoute.named("config", "changes")
///                                .withSequentialReplyType(Config.self)
///     server.registerRoute(changesRoute, handler: configChanges)
/// }
///
/// private func configChanges(provider: SequentialResultProvider<Config>) {
///     <# implementation here #>
/// }
/// ```
///
/// On macOS 10.15 and later async functions and closures can also be registered as the handler for a route. For command line tools, such as the helper tools
/// installed with `SMJobBless`, async functions and closures are only supported on macOS 12 and later. This is an
/// [Apple limitation](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/701969) unrelated to SecureXPC.
///
/// ### Starting a Server
/// Once all of the routes are registered, the server must be told to start processing requests. In most cases this should be done with:
/// ```swift
/// server.startAndBlock()
/// ```
///
/// Server instances which conform to ``XPCNonBlockingServer`` can also be started in a non-blocking manner:
/// ```swift
/// server.start()
/// ```
///
/// ### Terminating a Process Containing a Server
/// There is intentionally no way to stop an `XPCServer` once it has been started. Of course it is possible to terminate the containing process; however, it is
/// recommend you avoid doing this as it introduces more opportunities for race conditions. For example, if the process containing the server terminates itself after
/// handling a request from a client, there is a possibility that a subsequent request will be received by the server process before termination has completed meaning
/// it will nearly instantly fail with an ``XPCError/connectionInterrupted`` error. Allow launchd to automatically manage the lifecycle of your service.
